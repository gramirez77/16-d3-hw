# 16-d3-hw

This is the homework for week 16 of the *UNC Data Analytics Boot Camp*. This one is on D3.

Some extra changes to the starter code done:
* `d3Style.css` changed to add additional styles to make SVG responsive.
* `app.js` incorporated changes to make SVG responsive.
* Way to handle errors in `d3.csv` changed in *d3 v5*. Now *d3 v5* uses the fetch API to return a promise. Example code from in class activities was not working and had to be restructured.

I also completed the optional portion making the chart interactive and using transitions for both axis, and bubbles. Also added the tooltips.
