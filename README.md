# 16-d3-hw

This is the homework for week 16 of the *UNC Data Analytics Boot Camp*. This one is on D3.

Some extra changes to the starter code done:
* `d3Style.css` changed to add additional styles to make SVG responsive.
* `app.js` incorporated changes to make SVG responsive.
* Handling of errors in `d3.csv` method changed in *d3 v5*. Now *d3 v5* uses fetch API to return a promise. Example code from in class activities was not working properly.

Code also includes the optional portion with multi-dimension in x and y and transitions in axis, and bubbles after dimension change.
