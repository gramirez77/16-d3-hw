# 16-d3-hw
This is the homework for week 16 of UNC Data Analytics Boot Camp. This one is on D3.

Some additional changes done:
* `d3Style.css` changed to add additional styles to make SVG responsive.
* `app.js` incorporated changes to make chart SVG responsive.
* Handling of errors in `d3.csv` method changed in `d3 v5`. `d3 v5` uses the fetch API to return a promise. Example code from in class activities was not working properly.
